# What I Learned from this Assignment

## I Learned Markdown

Markdown is a way to format my README files allowing for a easy to read page to be shown on github.

## I learned how branching and merging works
Branches are copies of the original project that can be changed without adding these changes to the main branch. Merging allows users to combine the work of one branch with another to keep the changes in both.` I learned all this information from the [GitHub Syntax Wiki](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links/)
